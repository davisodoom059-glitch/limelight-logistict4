**Limelight Logistics Overview (Summary)**  

Limelight Logistics is a project to build a modern, mobile‑friendly logistics website. It provides clear service information, booking and tracking tools, and a consistent design across all pages. The site uses a simple folder structure:  

- `docs/` → contains separate HTML files for each page (Home, Services, About, Booking, Tracking, Contact, etc.).  
- `assets/css/style.css` → one shared stylesheet for consistent design.  
- `README.md` → explains the project goals and setup.  

Key features include a sticky responsive navigation bar, mobile hamburger menu, active page highlighting, smooth scrolling, and a professional layout for services, booking, tracking, and contact details. The site is designed to be deployed easily on GitHub Pages, making it accessible online with minimal setup.
